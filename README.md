# mol-mod
TEST module for handling sequence-based occurrence data in [Biodiversity Atlas Sweden](https://bioatlas.se/) / [SBDI](https://biodiversitydata.se/). See [GitHub Pages on molecular data services](https://biodiversitydata-se.github.io/mol-data/) for more info.

Uses some (e.g. BLAST) code from [Baltic sea Reference Metagenome web server](https://github.com/EnvGen/BARM_web_server).

### Overview
Flask (+ jQuery) app for BLAST and metadata (currently just gene & pcr primer) search of sequence-based occurrences in SBDI, via separate BLAST and Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV) databases. Views of the ASV db are exposed via [postgREST server](https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/index.html), and accessed in API calls (for metadata part). The BLAST db was also pre-built from one of these views, using additional python code (to be shared soon).

### Branches
* **master:** Based on older idea of how to represent ASV in Darwin Core, i.e. using ASV id as scientificName AND taxonID (requiring db-200529-schema-data-sciname.sql).
* **taxonid:** Based on using ASV id as taxonID only (requiring shema db-200XXX-schema-data-taxonid.sql).

### Files and folders
* **molmod:** Flask app
* **misc:** BLAST db, dump (schema + test data) from ASV db (postgres), postgREST config file and some test query files for BLAST
* **environment.yml:** [Conda file](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)
